            <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; color: #444;">
                At the National Animal Foster Network, we believe no one should have to choose between their well-being and their beloved companion.
                Many individuals facing medical crises, mental health challenges, addiction recovery, or domestic violence are forced to give up their pets
                just to receive the care they need. This is a heartbreaking choice no one should ever face.
                <br><br>
                NAFN exists to bridge that gap. We provide temporary foster care, support services, and hope â€” ensuring people can seek help
                while knowing their animals are safe, loved, and waiting for their return. We are not just protecting animals; we are protecting families,
                dignity, and healing.

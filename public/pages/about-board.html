        <h3 class="board-member-title">Secretary</h3>
        <p class="board-member-description">
          Katherine is a single mother of 3 amazing adult children. She was a massage therapist for 12 years before becoming a nurse. Katherine worked as a Home Health RN Case Manager for over 12 years with patients ranging in age from 4 years to 103 years old. She has seen the enormous positive impact of animals in her patients' lives. Many of them live alone and struggle with depression and anxiety. Their animals provide a source of companionship and love that would not otherwise be available. In many cases their animal is what makes their life tolerable. Over the years there were many instances when her patients had to go to the hospital and there was nobody to care for their pet. Katherine has taken animals home herself, reached out to church members for support and other caregivers and neighbors who have taken animals into their homes. There have been occasions when there was no solution and a patient who really needed support refused care because they had no one to care for their pet. An organization that would provide an option for patients to get the care they need and to be secure in the knowledge that their animal is well taken care of would fill a huge need in the community.
